 * This class defines a policy where we try to respect the SLA as much as possible while also
 * trying to store the VMs in different nodes according to their IDs affinity. All VMs with an
 * id between [X00-X99] (where X is the same digit (0,1,2...)) must be on distinct nodes, balancing
 * between the 2 switches(Ml110G4 nodes connected to one and Ml110G5 to another).
 *
 * The main problem here is that when a fault tolerant schedule places two VM replicas over the same host,
 * if the host fails both VMs get lost, besides when one switch is turned off all host connected to it lost
 * the connection, and then their VMs can be considered . With this policy, the energy is slightly increased but the penalties
 * are reduced in half resulting into increasing the Revenue.
